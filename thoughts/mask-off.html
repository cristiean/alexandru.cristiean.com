    <p>
    Over the years I grew entitled to people's presence, often taking it for granted.
    Showing up scattered and emotionally unkept, repeatedly, over a long period of time, was unhygienic for both&mdash; and unfair to them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    "Isn't that's what friends are for?". Sure, but as an exception&mdash; not the rule.
    It's better not to abuse paracetamol or antibiotics just to get by,
    but to get rid of what causes one headaches or strengthen one's immune system instead.
    Medicine is for the sick, not a crutch for the healthy. It's also bitter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I always took pride in being neat and tidy on my own and out in the world
    (passed down from my dad's side, this got instilled in me as a core value).
    Have I neglected this deeper, less superficial domain that also requires hygiene?
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It seems I have.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Enamoured with the superficial, my heart was lined with a deep desire to be highly regarded, to be the golden boy.
    I took it on myself to live beyond others' imaginations, and go further than even they thought possible.
    Vainglory and leading others astray&mdash; a double whammy in Peter's book.
    </p>

    <p>
    It had to stop, eventually. Fuelling the charade became evermore tiring and expensive, with diminishing highs for my ego.
    Also, people started smelling the bullshit a long time ago. People are smart.
    </p>

    <p>The comedown was brutal. It still is. But there's no other way.</p>

    <p>
    Thank God for those who stuck with me...
    Regardless of my lack of regard.
    </p>
