    <p>
    Over the years I grew entitled to people's presence, often taking it for granted.
    Showing up scattered and emotionally unkept, repeatedly, over a long period of time, was unhygienic for both and unfair to them.

    <p>
    "Isn't that's what friends are for?". Sure, but as an exception&mdash; not the rule.
    It's better not to abuse paracetamol or antibiotics just to get by,
    but to remove the triggers of one's headaches or strengthen one's immune system.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Have I done enough to look after myself before going out into the world?
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Probably not.
    </p>

    <p>
    Thank God for those who stuck with me regardless of my lack of regard.
